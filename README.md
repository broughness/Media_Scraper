## Current Release | [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-v0.1.1-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/dMacGit/Media_Scraper/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

### This is a Media Wish-list web scraper 

This script, currently grabs from Mightyape.co.nz a _**"wishlist"**_ from a private url, and returns the list 
in text form, along with information about current item prices/sales/discounts etc.

*only works for Mightape.co.nz so far, but will add support for other online stores.*

Currently supports the Mightape.co.nz site and its wishlist function

**You'll need to add your link reference to the private_link.txt file.
Drop the link file in a folder called "private_data"**
