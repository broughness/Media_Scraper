# Media_Scraper

### This is a Media Wish-list web scraper 

This script, currently grabs from Mightyape.co.nz a _**"wishlist"**_ from a private url, and returns the list 
in text form, along with information about current item prices/sales/discounts etc.

*only works for Mightape.co.nz so far, but will add support for other online stores.*
